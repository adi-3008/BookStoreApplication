# BookStoreApplication

**"I have created a Book Store Application that follows the MVVM Architecture for its working. It contains the following three layers: view layer, viewmodel, and model. The packages are:**

**api**: to fetch data from the URL https://run.mocky.io/v3/b07fca4a-01e0-4000-985d-8baa538dee35. It contains a list of books with information like title, author, pages, etc.

**model**: it is the data class that represents a book model.

**repository**: which takes the data from sources and gives it to the viewmodel layer.

**viewmodel**: which observes the changes made in the data collected by the repository.

**views**: which contains activities and adapters for RecyclerView, etc. I have used data binding, which binds the views to the data observed from the viewmodel layer.

Below are some working images of my app."
